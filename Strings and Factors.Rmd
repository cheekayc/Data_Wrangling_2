# Strings and regex

You can use `str_detect` to find cases where the match exists (often useful in conjunction with `filter`), 
and you can use `str_replace` to replace an instance of a match with something else (often useful in conjunction with `mutate`). 

In the following examples we’ll mostly focus on vectors to avoid the complication of data frames, but we’ll see those shortly.

```{r EX1}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")
```
